Welcome to the T.A.TOOl!

This is a program for struggling TA's, by a struggling TA. Imagine this scene, near and dear to your heart, you're sitting up in the CS lab
at one or two in the morning. You're only half way through grading all of your students' projects, and you have an 8am class tomorrow. For
most of us, it's game over, I'm going to put this aside and finish it tomorrow. But the faces of entrepid young CS freshmen flash across
your mind... You have to stay up and finish it so that you can reach these kieeeeeds. Now, thanks to Tatoo, you don't have to burn yourself
alive to keep those naive fuckers warm. You just test one student's program, record the inputs you used to get a nullpointer error (there's
always at LEAST one), and let Tatoo do the rest. It will automatically compile and test each student's project against all of the input 
procedures you want it to.

# Important Notes
For Tatoo to work, you need to have g++ installed and included in your PATH. 
Tatoo only works on Windows.
Tatoo always uses the C++ 17 standard.

# Usage
When running the program, it's <i>important</i> that the settings.txt folder is properly configured for your projects. It's been tested 
using relative pathing, and I think that absolute pathing will work, but you need to adhere to these specifications
